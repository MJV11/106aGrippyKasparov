106a Final Project

a computer to play a game of chess using a UR-10 robot arm with a smart suction cup that can pick up custom chess pieces using haptic search, a searching technique that we improved upon for the UC Berkeley Embodied Dexterity lab.
The brain of the opponent is done by utilizing the stockfish API to analyze an encoded board state and return the best moves, which the robotic arm then performs. The arm relies upon PID controlled path trajectories between all the squares, relying on calculating the coordinates of each square by knowing where the center of the board is with color thresholding and the size of each square. The suction cup is actuated by a solenoid to control the flow of air in and out of a vacuum generator. The hand of the robot knows when it has grabbed a peice because it can measure the pressure of the cup. The cup has 4 chambers with individual pressures. If a pressure reading in one cup is less than another, the robot knows that it must move in the opposite direction to actuate all four chambers and properly grab the peice, allowing us to bypass problems with computer vision and with traditional gripper end-effectors. I lost to the robot, a lot.
